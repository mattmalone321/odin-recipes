        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 T-bone steak</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 glass water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 °F.</li>
            <li>Generously season the steak with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to a large cast iron skillet. Preheat the skillet over high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the steak to the preheated skillet and sear on both sides for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the steak to a rack placed on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Finish the steak in the preheated oven. Cook until the internal temperature reads 115 °F, the carryover cooking will bring the temperature up to rare. Let the steak rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the steak rests, place an oven-safe serving platter in the oven.</li>
            <li>Remove the platter from the oven and place the steak on it. Pour the glass of water over the steak.</li>
            <li>Ring that dinner bell because it's serving time!</li>
