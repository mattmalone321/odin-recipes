        <h2>Finally, get a taste of what everyone's been talking about!</h2>
        Rum Ham is a nutritious and delicious dish best served under a bridge in Philadelphia.  Created by Frank Reynolds during a period of deep introspection, the dish has found mainstream success all over the world since its inception.  The dish is also usable as a life preserver.  Do not ingest the full ham in one sitting as side-effects may include drowsiness, liver failure and <strong>whatever </strong>Cricket's got going on.
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Smoked 10 pound ham, fully-cooked, bone-in</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/3 cup rum</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, score the ham in a diagonal pattern, making cuts about 1-inch deep. Turn the ham and score it in a diagonal pattern again to form a cross pattern.</li>
            <li>Place the ham on the rack of a roasting pan. Pour 1 cup of water into the pan. Cover with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake for 2 to 2 ½ hours.</li>
            <li>Whisk sugar, rum, and mustard together.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil from the ham and brush the ham with the rum mixture. Cook the ham for 15 more minutes uncovered. Remove the ham from the oven and brush with the rum mixture. Bake for another 15 minutes or until browned.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        Use an instant-read meat thermometer to tell when the ham has finished cooking. It should read 140°F.
